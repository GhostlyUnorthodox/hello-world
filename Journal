<h1>A diary of a insanely mad and really weird nerd type Christain who is a pacisifist</h1>

<p1>If the heading didn't do it for you, I am Geremy R. Smith and I have so many different emotions every day that I don't really try and categorize it (well, other then the title) because I am because we as a human race has to put a label on everything. And my question to the world is, why don't we just have good and bad? I mean I understand that we have to do name certain things, but, why so many?</p1>

<b>03/22/2017</b>
So todays events so far include having gotten a $80.00 paycheck and using 40 for my negative account and the other 40 for deposit. I still need shoes, pants (slacks), and polo shirt. I am also trying to retake the CPR/AED course and also looking at getting the book for homework. Dalton from my work just showed me about the Naro video store and how many Doctor Who DVD's they have. I am really excited and also turned on by how many beautiful women are down town. It is really hard to be single. The cool part is that tomorrow, I am shaving my entire head. Apparently I won't be fully bald, but I am happy I get to donate none the less. I will say this, if I do have enough money left over, I am planning on finishing the job (provided I go bald). They might not shave my beard so at least I get to go get a straight razor from the dudes in the mall.</pre></p2>
