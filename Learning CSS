    <p class="center">The one guy that will get farted on is the one to fall asleep first. Yes, I am twenty six years old, writing codes about farting. Deal with it... You have nice boobs.</p>

<p class="center">Who looked? My kinda duuuude. Karma Five., up top!</p>

<p>If you are wondering what Karma Five means and you are mad at why I was talking about boobs, I am glad you saw it. It means that you should not be looking at this. If you are my friend and I shared this with yout, then you should know that while I will never actually every say this or promote boobs to be sexy in public, you agreed to be my friend. Your offendedness is not on me.... If you are offended. If not why are you even reading this. :p</p>

<p>One of the major things I love about coding is that I can create a lot with barely anything. The problem is what would benefit the world that I can create. I mean I do want to be rich one day. Well, not the kind of rich everything is probably thinking. But at the same time, I would love to donate a lot of what I make because I don't need a pool the size of a whale to myself. It gets lonely. ALso if the haters are still here, I hope to one day jiggle your boobs. And/or your.... Oh yeah buddy, that's right, If your a guy, I swing both ways ;) Cash me outside..... hubba bubba</p>
