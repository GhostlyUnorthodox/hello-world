<p class="center">Who looked? My kinda duuuude. Karma Five., up top!</p>

<p>If you are wondering what Karma Five means and you are mad at why I was talking about boobs, I am glad you saw it. It means that you should not be looking at this. If you are my friend and I shared this with yout, then you should know that while I will never actually every say this or promote boobs to be sexy in public, you agreed to be my friend. Your offendedness is not on me.... If you are offended. If not why are you even reading this. :p</p>
